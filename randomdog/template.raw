## Hello ^v^
I just make projects and seldom work on them after a couple of months, mainly because it was a boring idea. But here are some projects I'm ACTUALLY working on:
 - [sulphurous.cf](https://github.com/themysticsavages/sulphurous.cf)
 - [human](https://github.com/themysticsavages/human)
 - [generator3](https://github.com/themysticsavages/generator3)

## Other things:
 - I have no socials except Discord which I don't use that much, so don't ask.
 - Don't look at my old projects. They suck
